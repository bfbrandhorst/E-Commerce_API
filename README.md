# E-Commerce_API
This back end server API will allow an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies to stay up to date with their competitors. Within this application are files purposed for creating and seeding databases.  The server and router files are also included to allow the Update, Get, Post, Put, and Delete functionalities to perform for not only single items but whole categories.
